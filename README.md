# Personal Website

## Description
Welcome to my personal portfolio website. Built using only HTML5/CSS + Javascript without the use of any frameworks. It showcases sections for a Home, About, Skills, Portfolio and Contact. I built this site to showcase my personal skills and projects, while simultaneously learning more about Web Development through HTML, CSS & JS. It is currently responsive and contains a hamburger menu when the screen is smaller than a certain size, contains animated text and scrolling, and has a working contact form in which I can view the responses. I hope to continue to update this site with new features as I learn frameworks and more skills. Deployed using Github Pages and updated via Github.
